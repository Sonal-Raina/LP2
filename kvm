Check Virtualization Support on Ubuntu 20.04
1. Before you begin with installing KVM, check if your CPU supports hardware virtualization:

// egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo

If the command returns a value of 0, your processor is not capable of running KVM. On the other hand, any other number means you can proceed with the installation.

2. Now, check if your system can use KVM acceleration by typing:

//sudo kvm-ok
If kvm-ok returns an error stating KVM acceleration cannot be used, try solving the problem by installing cpu-checker.

3. To install cpu-checker, run the following command:

//sudo apt install cpu-checker

4. When the installation completes, //restart the terminal.

You are now ready to start installing KVM.

Step 1: Install KVM Packages
1. First, update the repositories:

//sudo apt update

2. Then, install essential KVM packages with the following command:

//sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients bridge-utils

3. When prompted, type Y, press ENTER, and wait for the installation to finish.

Step 2: Authorize Users
1. Only members of the libvirt and kvm user groups can run virtual machines. Add a user to the libvirt group by typing:

//sudo adduser ‘username’ libvirt

Replace username with the actual username.

2. Now do the same for the kvm group:

//sudo adduser ‘[username]’ kvm   

Step 3: Verify the Installation
1. Confirm the installation was successful by using the virsh command:

//virsh list --all

2. Or use the systemctl command to check the status of libvirtd:

//sudo systemctl status libvirtd

3. Press Q to quit the status screen.

4. If the virtualization daemon is not active, activate it with the following command:

//sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd
